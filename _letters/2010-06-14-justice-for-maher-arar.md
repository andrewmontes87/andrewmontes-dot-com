title: "22:  Justice for Maher Arar "

Mr. President, today the Supreme Court declined to review the case of Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen who was subjected to extraordinary rendition while passing through a New York airport in 2002. He was suspected of affiliation with a terrorist organization, a charge that turned out to be spurious. Arar was kidnapped and rendered to Syrian officials, where he was subjected to torture for more than a year before his eventual release. Since then, Arar has searched in vain for justice, at least an apology and compensation, from the US government that sent an innocent man to be tortured. Today's Supreme Court decision not to examine the case ensures that his story will never be heard in an American courtroom. This is an incredibly regrettable state of affairs. The Canadian government has already issued a formal apology from the Prime Minister and provided $10 million in damages in 2007. Your administration and Congress should follow suit and provide some measure of justice. I have little hope this will happen, however. It seems clear that the government is more concerned with protecting those who committed torture than providing justice for the victims. By repeatedly invoking the state secrets defense, your administration's suppression of the judiciary has ensured that to date there has not been a day in court for any of the torture victims of the Bush administration. Secrecy and silence will not make these crimes go away. We must face them head on, provide full justice for victims, prosecute criminals, and restore our national integrity. A good way to start would be a straightforward apology to Maher Arar.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
