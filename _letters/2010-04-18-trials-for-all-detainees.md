Mr. President, recently Attorney General Eric Holder spoke before the Senate Judiciary Committee and revealed some deeply disturbing information. He indicated that there are 48 people classified as enemy combatants that will never be given trials or military commissions. I strongly believe that all suspects should be tried in courts, not military commissions that allow hearsay evidence. But to deny people even those meager protections provided by the commissions and institute a policy of indefinite detention is unacceptable. It is a blatant mockery of the ideals of our country. Nobody should be locked up or executed without a transparent process with safeguards against abuse of the system. Suspected terrorists should be tried in civilian courts, not stuck in a cell and left to rot without any effort to determine if they are in fact guilty of the crimes they are accused of.

I'm sure you are aware that the majority of Guantanamo detainees were later found to be innocent. The chaos of war in the initial invasion of Afghanistan lead to many innocent men being captured by our local allies and sold to us as suspected terrorists. These people were brutalized by the Bush administration's illegal detainment and interrogation policies, for nothing more than being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Recent statements from Bush administration official Lawrence Wilkerson claim that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld all knew that the majority of detainees were innocent, but refused to release them because it would make the administration look bad. That the President would believe that human lives can be held hostage to the needs of his political capital is abhorrent. These details illustrate how a clear and fair system for trying suspected terrorists is so crucial to the health of our nation.

Mr. President, the people at Guantanamo Bay have been found guilty of no crimes. If there is evidence against them, it should be aired in civilian trials, not kangaroo courts. The worst approach would be to simply ignore the problem and hold them with no way of reviewing their status as enemy combatant. The Supreme Court has already ruled that these detainees are entitled to habeas proceedings. It is your responsibility to ensure the integrity of our justice system by trusting the courts and rejecting indefinite detention.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
