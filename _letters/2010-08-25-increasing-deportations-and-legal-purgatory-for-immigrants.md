title: "36:  Increasing Deportations and 'Legal Purgatory' for Immigrants"

Mr. President, the current debate over immigration has taken place under a cloud of poisonous, opportunistic attacks. Right-wing political candidates, anxious to play off of American’s economic anxieties for personal gain, portray immigrants as ‘illegal persons’ who don’t pay taxes and steal jobs from citizens. Of course, the truth is that the recession has struck immigrant communities disproportionately hard, but that does not stop the attempts to make them scapegoats. SB 1070, the Arizona immigration law allowing police to check the residency status of anybody they detain, is one example of this disturbing trend. It is heartening that your administration has decided to preemptively challenge the law, as its implementation would be a grave setback for civil rights.

Unfortunately, this admirable legal challenge does not change the fact that the federal government’s overall immigration policy has focused on increased enforcement while ignoring a long-term solution. While the emerging political consensus is that comprehensive immigration reform is not a priority and will be shelved indefinitely, there was no problem whatsoever getting bipartisan support for a recent $600 million border security bill. Deportations are at a record high, and there is an enormous backlog of cases facing understaffed immigration courts. Right now, there are 248,000 immigration cases pending, another new record. With a wait time that can reach as high as three years, these people are held in a virtual ‘legal purgatory’, separated from their families and often denied legal representation.

Part of the problem is the large number of vacancies on these immigration courts. A staggering 1 out of every 6 judicial positions is unfilled, exacerbating the delays caused by ramped-up enforcement. Immediately acting to fill these vacancies would be a simple yet effective way to improve these awful conditions. In addition, immigration enforcement should focus on dangerous criminals, not innocent families. Increasing deportations of honest immigrants does nothing to improve security and destroys countless lives. Finally, Congress must enact an immigration reform bill that includes a path to citizenship for the approximately 12 million undocumented people living in America. As President, you have the help of the national bully pulpit to help make this happen. Please, don’t let the hate mongering continue. Take a stand and support the rights of immigrants.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
