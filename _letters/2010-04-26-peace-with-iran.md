Mr. President, our country faces many threats in the 21st century. Some are large and will require tremendous effort to overcome, such as climate change. Others are very minor threats, and do not deserve the attention given to them by politicians and the media. I am thinking here of the nation of Iran. The leaders and mullahs in Tehran and Qum run a despotic government that oppresses its citizens and covertly funds terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. I supported the recent 'Green' civil disobedience, and will cheer heartily when the regime falls. However, they do not constitute a significant threat to the United States. Their armies are puny when compared to the might of the American military. They have a GDP that is 38 times smaller than ours. Yet Iran is frequently put forward as the most dangerous threat we face by pundits and politicians who urge immediate military action. This position is baffling when you realize those who most wish for conflict with Iran would likely reject almost any attempt to address the real threat of climate change. I suspect that this obsession with Iran comes from latent prejudice against the religion of Islam, along with a desire to satisfy the military-industrial complex's demand for never-ending war. Mr. President, I am writing to ask you to reject those who fantasize about attacking Iran, end the failing quest for more economic sanctions, and engage with Iran on a level of mutual respect. As Iran is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, they should be guaranteed the right to develop peaceful civilian nuclear energy, irregardless of American prejudice. They should certainly not be subjected to military attack - besides the negative side-effects of a likely counterattack on our forces in the Persian Gulf and a disruption of global energy supplies, the debacle of Iraq has demonstrated that the United States has neither the ability nor the right to effectively implement regime change. My greatest fear is that our country will suffer terribly as we are stricken by the obvious threats we were ignoring as we ranted and raved about a foreign land that poses no threat to our safety at home. Please, seek peace with Iran.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
