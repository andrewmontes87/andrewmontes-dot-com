Mr. President, today Norwegian officials announced they had arrested 3 suspects accused of working with al-Qaeda in the attempted NYC subway attack of Sep 2009. The plot, uncovered by British spies, would have been the biggest attack in the US since 9/11. Also connected are Abid Naseer, arrested yesterday in Britain, and Adnan G. el-Shukrijumah, charged yesterday in a federal court in Brooklyn. Relating to the 2006 plot to bomb airplanes with liquid explosives, in Britain today Ibrahim Savant, Arafat Waheed Khan and Waheed Zaman were found guilty of conspiracy to murder. This quick succession of events, a culmination of diligent intelligence collection and communication with our allies, demonstrates the effectiveness of using police and judiciaries as the proper tools to prevent attacks and prosecute terrorists.

There was yet another terrorist conviction yesterday. At Guantanamo Bay, Ibrahim al-Qosi plead guilty to conspiracy with al-Qaeda and providing material support for terrorism. He was being tried in a military commission, an irregular trial where the deck is stacked against the defendant. Al-Qosi's crime was to be Osama bin-Laden's cook. There is little evidence that he ever had knowledge of, let alone helped carry out a terrorist attack. In fact, it seems likely that the only reason al-Qosi was tried in the military tribunal is precisely because the evidence against him is so thin. This is similar to the case against Omar Khadr, a Canadian child soldier accused of traditional battlefield attacks yet charged with war crimes in a kangaroo court and prosecuted on evidence coerced after torture.

When federal courts have proven themselves such promising venues for terrorist prosecutions, why do you insist on compromised military commissions? The fact that you lack the evidence for a successful prosecution does not allow you to create ad-hoc judicial systems and assume indefinite detention powers. As a Constitutional scholar, you know that the stability of our nation depends on a balance between the three branches of government, where even the Executive has to follow the law. As a man who spent part of his life in the Muslim world, you must also know that abusive detainee policies do more to encourage terrorism against us than bin-Laden's cook ever could. If a person suspected of terrorist crimes can not be successfully prosecuted in federal court, they should be released. This is a fundamental demand of our system of law, and it must be respected.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
