Mr. President, BBC News recently reported that they had collected accounts from people who claimed they had been held in a secret 'black site' prison in Bagram Airbase. As you know, the old Bagram prison was notorious for harsh treatment and detainee deaths. It was also one of the first places where torture was used by U.S. forces as a means to collecting intelligence. The prison's reputation as a torture dungeon was likely a deciding factor in the move to the new Parwan complex earlier this year. However, investigations from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and now the BBC point to a second, separate facility that still treats detainees cruelly. At the 'Black Prison', the prisoners described treatment similar to the abuses of the Bush administration's military interrogations: sleep deprivation, extreme temperatures, stress positions, random beatings. Now, the International Committee of the Red Cross has confirmed the existence of the secret prison. The military has yet to admit the existence of this facility, but it appears to be run through the Joint Special Operations Command, leaving it outside both Gen. McChrystal's command and the executive order ensuring lawful interrogations, which applied only to the CIA.

Abusing detainees and running 'black sites' does not offer any substantive intelligence benefit. Instead, like the disastrous invasion of Iraq and the deaths of civilians from unmanned drones, they provide our enemy with propaganda to bolster their ranks. Indeed, as a candidate you explicitly acknowledged the effect our actions on the world stage have had in inciting violence against us. So why, years after you pledged to clean up interrogations and detention policies, is there evidence of a secret prison abusing prisoners right now? There is no justification for mistreating prisoners. It is against our mission and our morals. I urge you to immediately close the 'Black Prison' and end torture as an interrogation technique.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
