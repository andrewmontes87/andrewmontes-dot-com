title: "25:  Preliminary Torture Review Nearing Completion"
date: 24-06-2010

Mr. President, in a recent speech Attorney General Eric Holder indicated that the preliminary review of evidence relating to the torture of detainees is nearing completion. Tasked to Assistant US Attorney John Durham, this review is intended to determine whether any laws were broken by by US forces or military contractors when they used brutal interrogation techniques, techniques which lead to the deaths of over 100 detainees. However, the Attorney General has repeatedly stressed the limited scope of this investigation. This review is only looking for so-called 'rogue elements' who went beyond the methods approved by the Bush-era Office of Legal Counsel.

With an investigation that is so narrow, there is a significant problem: the majority of the torture that occurred was within the bounds of the Yoo-Bybee OLC memos, yet it was still illegal. The OLC's hideous definition of 'severe pain' as only that which threatens organ failure left the door open to countless abuses that were plainly against the letter and the spirit of our nation's anti-torture laws. This investigation seems to be looking for the mythical 'few bad apples' continuously invoked by the previous administration as they tried to cover up the fact that they had designed and implemented a systematic torture regime. What is needed is a full-scale investigation into the high level White House officials who are the source of the crime. Torture is illegal, even when you have politically appointed lawyers to argue that the executive can break any laws it wants in the pursuit of national security. The laws against torture were specifically designed to be resistant to this type of apology - they extend to all American forces, everywhere, all the time. Any investigation that hounds field agents while giving the administration ringleaders a pass will be unsatisfactory, and fail to lay the issue to rest.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
