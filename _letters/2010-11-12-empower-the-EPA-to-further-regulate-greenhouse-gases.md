Mr. President,

Climate change is a direct, immediate, and continually escalating threat. Every day that we do not take action to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide makes it more likely that irreversible harm will be wreaked on our biosphere, and more expensive to try to mitigate the damage. A new report from the International Energy Agency has estimated that the inability of world leaders to come to an agreement regarding climate change policy at the Copenhagen convention last year will cost the world at least $1 trillion. This astounding figure, an almost 10% rise in the total cost necessary to reverse global climate change, is deeply sobering, and can make the obstacles before us seem insurmountable. But every delay continues to increase both the dangers we face and the costs necessary to avert them.

The International Energy Agency is an intergovernmental body with 28 members, including most of the developed world, that advises on energy policy. It endorses the scientific consensus that atmospheric carbon dioxide must be reduced to 450 parts per million to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Unfortunately, the political consensus in the United States is that climate change legislation is not a priority. Some politicians are opposed to regulating greenhouse gases on ideological grounds, while others flat out deny the existence of climate change. Now that the Republican party has taken control of the House of Representatives, a bipartisan climate change bill is less likely than ever. Yet the dangers of inaction have not decreased.

We cannot allow ignorant Congressmen to hold the entire world hostage to their obstructionist agenda. The Supreme Court has already spoken on this issue three years ago, finding in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. Beginning next year, large polluters will have to purchase permits designed to reduce the nation’s overall output of carbon dioxide. This is a great start, and will hopefully propel the use of renewable energy sources. But these permits and fees are not as effective as a uniform carbon tax, or even the flawed cap-and-trade program. If Congress will not step forward, the EPA should be authorized to take further steps towards reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide. The very future of our planet depends on it.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
