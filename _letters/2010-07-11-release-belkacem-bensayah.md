title: "30:  Release Belkacem Bensayah"

Mr. President, Attorney General Eric Holder's Justice Department has been dealt another rebuke by the judiciary, with a federal court finding that there was not enough evidence against Belkacem Bensayah to justify his detention. Bensayah had been detained on the basis of a shifting rationale, first for the alleged 'Bosnian subplot' attempted terrorist attack in 2001 on Sarajevo embassies, then accused of communication with high level al-Qaeda officials and funneling fighters to Afghanistan. The evidence does not uphold these claims - it seems the most that could be proven against Bensayah was possession of fraudulent documents. In November of 2008, a federal judge ordered the other five accused in the plot released due to lack of charges. They had been held at Guantanamo Bay, some suffering serious abuse, for seven years without being charged. Unfortunately for Bensayah, the judge then found that there was sufficient evidence to keep him imprisoned. No longer: the DC Court of Appeals just found that there was no evidence linking him to al-Qaeda, and the evidence against him consisted solely of unsubstantiated intelligence reports and conjecture. This is simply not good enough to hold a man without trial for nine years. The case has been remanded to the District Court, but unless there is some evidence against him that has yet to be produced, Bensayah will be released. He will join the ever-growing group of people held by the government for years without charges before finally being released due to lack of evidence.

Bensayah certainly committed a serious crime in possessing a fake passport, for which somebody can be sentenced to years in prison. Such a charge would have been most legitimate if it came from the Bosnian government, where he committed his crime and was arrested. Instead, either for political gain or because the maximum sentence for such a conviction was not long enough for our government's liking, he was held for years in Guantanamo Bay, denied any chance to plead his innocence. Even now, the Justice Department argued wholeheartedly against granting him habeas corpus, the mere chance to hear his case before a court of law. In all of this, the Justice Department is perhaps the most egregious offender; even when it became clear that there was no substantial evidence against Bensayah, they still prosecuted him relentlessly using scare tactics and invoking national security to continue his unjust detention. This is sad, yet unsurprising coming from an agency with a history including denying detainees Geneva Convention protections and declaring torture legal under a warped interpretation of Executive authority.

Ultimately, the Justice Department's moral decline can be traced back to the widespread politicization of Executive agencies under former President Bush. But there is now a new administration, one that campaigned on a sensible approach to counterterrorism and endorsed the Boumedienne case granting Guantanamo Bay detainees habeas rights. Why is Bensayah not yet released? This question can join the countless others raised by your detainee policies: Why are we using military commissions to try people who can't be convicted in real courts? Why has Mohamed Hassan Odaini not been released, when the government has known for years that he is innocent? Why do people arrested outside of Afghanistan lose their habeas rights when transferred to Bagram? Why are forty-eight people being held without trials of any kind? These problems must be dealt with before they rot us to the core. I strongly urge you to reform your detainee policies: end the military commissions; end indefinite detention; end the use of state secrecy arguments to continue unjust detentions; close Guantanamo without exporting its legal black-hole status; extend habeas rights to foreign Bagram detainees; in general, craft the detainee policies you said you endorsed as a candidate.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
