title: "10:  Investigate Torture"

Mr. President, as you know the pre-trial hearings for Omar Khadr's military commission are currently underway in Guantanamo Bay. Today Khadr's defense team revealed that they will call as a witness a military interrogator who will testify that he/she threatened Khadr with rape during questioning. While this would be despicable in any interrogation, the fact that Khadr was only 15 years old when he was captured makes it even more disgusting. As the hearing continues, and more disturbing details of the previous administrations detainee policies emerge, the pressure will mount for the prosecution to make a deal with Khadr. If this happens, the evidence of torture and abuse should not be simply swept under the rug and forgotten. The law requires investigations when presented with evidence of lawbreaking, especially by those tasked with enforcing the law. This new revelation is just another in a long line of assaults on human dignity that have been a part of our response to terrorism since the attacks of 9/11. Your administration has pledged to end cruel treatment of detainees, but that is not enough. There must be fully transparent efforts to investigate and prosecute those who crafted the torture regime. The deliberate torture of prisoners is perhaps the most vile crime imaginable. Opposition to torture and abusive detainee policies lies at the heart of the Western liberal tradition of freedom. Without investigations, there will be a mighty stain on our collective conscience. I urge you to empower the Attorney General to commit to full-scale investigations of torture at Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, Bagram, CIA black sites, and anywhere else it may have occurred.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
