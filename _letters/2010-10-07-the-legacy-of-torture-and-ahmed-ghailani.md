Mr. President,

When a nation commits a crime so heinous as torture, it does not soon forget. Despite official exhortations to “Look Forward, Not Backward”, the torture policies of the previous administration cannot be swept under the rug. It is like a festering wound, remaining untreated and slowly poisoning the surrounding tissue. The negative effects begin to spread.

In the past week we have finally seen a truly damaging judicial rebuke to the Bush administration’s torture regime. It involved the case of United States v. Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian accused of planning and participating in the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. On Oct. 5th, District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan decided that “…the government has failed to prove that Abebe's testimony is sufficiently attenuated from Ghailani's coerced statements to permit its receipt in evidence.” In plain English, this order prevents the government’s key witness from testifying, a man who claims he sold Ghailani the TNT used in the attack. The reason the government cannot use this witness is because they only learned about him as a result of torturing the defendant.

This is the first time a Guantanamo detainee has been tried in federal court for terrorism crimes. But Ghailani alleges that the majority of the torture he suffered came when he was held by the CIA at one of the notorious “black site” interrogation centers. The prosecution has basically conceded that Ghailani was tortured, admitting that “…everything Ghailani said while in CIA custody was coerced.” Apparently they did not think this would have consequences on the admittance of their tainted evidence.

This is a bittersweet pill to swallow. On the one hand, it is refreshing to see the government suffer a setback as a result of its illegal actions, especially in such a landmark case. The Judge Kaplan is absolutely right to find that the abuse of the defendant precludes the use of this evidence. To quote at length from his decision,

“The Court has not reached this conclusion lightly. It is acutely aware of the perilous nature of the world in which we live. But the Constitution is the rock upon which our nation rests. We must follow it not only when it is convenient, but when fear and danger beckon in a different direction. To do less would diminish us and undermine the foundation upon which we stand.”

Unfortunately, we pay a price for this moral fortitude. A serious terrorist, almost certainly guilty could be acquitted. This is one reason why it was very unwise to torture suspects. But it does not mean we should abandon the federal court system as the proper venue to try terrorism suspects. The courts are the only legitimate place to try people accused of crimes. What this means is that our country will finally have to deal with our horrific legacy of torture.

The guilt for these crimes lies partly in a society that raises no serious objection to torture in their name, a culture of fear and xenophobia. But the acts were carried out by government agents at the behest of the White House, and this is where the sin truly originated. Your administration’s unwillingness to prosecute war criminals has lead to an embrace of other morally and legally dubious policies: continuing the military commissions, leaving Guantanamo open, and targeting American citizens for assassination. Even now, both the District Judge and the Attorney General have discussed the option of post-acquittal detainment. This would add to our multi-tiered justice system, already struggling to differentiate between suspects tried in courts, suspects tried in military commissions, and suspects held without any trial, a fourth level: suspects found innocent but held anyway.

Surgery is only one way to cure our body politic, to cleanse this sickness from our system. The people responsible for implementing the torture regime and its legal rationale should be tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Terrorism suspects, even those who have been tortured, should be tried in federal courts. Tainted evidence should not be allowed, even if this results in acquittals; and if suspects are acquitted, they should be released. The fundamental rule of law demands this. Without these steps, we fail our most cherished ideals.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
