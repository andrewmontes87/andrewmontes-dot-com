Mr. President,

The recent publication of 400,000 secret military records documenting the invasion and occupation of Iraq has lead to several serious accusations of illegal behavior by the United States armed forces. Special Rapporteur Manfred Nowak, the UN's chief investigator on torture, has said that the files provide evidence that US military officials violated the UN's convention against torture when they failed to investigate reports suggesting the systematic murder and abuse of detainees held by the newly-minted Iraqi authorities.

The non-refoulement clause of the UN's convention against torture makes it a crime to render a detainee to a government where they are likely to be tortured. If the records are true, US officials knew that the Iraqi police and military were torturing, raping, and even killing detainees transferred to their custody, yet still continued to hand people over, even ordering their subordinates to ignore evidence of major human rights violations. This would be complicity in torture, and it would require an immediate and thoroughly independent investigation.

The secret files, published by non-governmental advocacy group Wikileaks, offer a first-hand window into the violence in Iraq between 2004 and 2009. Wikileaks had previously published a similar cache of 90,000 documents on the Afghanistan war. Of course, the group is being maligned by the government and the mainstream media because these documents were procured without the military's permission. Julian Assange, the head of Wikileaks, has been called crazy and bashed as "un-American" (he's Australian); some right-wing commentators have even called for his extrajudicial assassination. Receiving worse treatment is Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, the soldier who leaked these documents to Assange's organization. Manning faces a court martial and a possible prison sentence of 52 years for his role in bringing the crimes of the powerful to light. Behind these vicious attacks are people who fear transparency, who want the evidence of their evil to remain buried forever.

Amid the rush to demonize those that dare to reveal government secrets, the evidence that the US committed huge human rights violations is receiving almost no attention. The documents also provide evidence that the US military has been substantially misrepresenting the civilian death toll. The conflict in Iraq has already been replete with evidence of major war crimes by the US, including torture at Abu Ghraib, the use of depleted uranium in Fallujah, and the falsification of the WMD evidence used to justify war in the first place. If the past is any indication, these new revelations will never be investigated, let alone prosecuted. But rest assured that they will not be forgotten. The invasion of Iraq was a war of aggression, the ultimate crime from which torture, massacre, and genocide spring forth. Every time the US does nothing when presented with evidence of its own illegal behavior, it is another crack in our facade of a country based on universal ideals of human dignity and respect. As President, you should follow Manfred Nowak's recommendation and begin an investigation into the allegations raised by the leaked documents. The only way to counter the incredible harm done to our global reputation by this horrific war is to start investigating the crimes we are responsible for. 

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
