Mr. President, I have written you before asking you to choose a strong progressive as your nominee to the Supreme Court. Today, you announced Elena Kagan as your candidate. On many issues, Kagan is a good replacement for Justice Stevens. Her purported willingness to attack big business when it engages in unconstitutional practices will be a welcome addition to a court that showed its pro-corporate stripes in the recent Citizens United case. However, in my previous letter I urged you to reject Kagan. My main concern is that she has shown a willingness to accept extreme theories of executive authority. Justice Stevens was the architect of some of the most important decisions of the Bush administration - the ones that forbade the government from detaining a person indefinitely without charges. This simple principle, that those accused of evil acts should be tried in a court of law, is not one I believe Elena Kagan shares. At the very least, if she disapproves of illegal indefinite detention, she has never come forward and said so - not during the abuses of the Bush administration, and not now. When there were so many qualified candidates who have explicitly rejected these authoritarian acts and the unitary executive theories they are based on, there is no apparent reason for choosing someone who has not done so. Coupled with your administration's continued endorsement of irregular military commissions and even assassination of an American citizen, the ominous conclusion is that this choice indicates you will continue to pursue policies that strip away civil liberties and ignore the constitutional limits on the executive branch.

Now that the choice of Elena Kagan has been announced, there is no going back. I honestly believe that I will find myself agreeing with her decisions the majority of the time. However, I sincerely fear that when questions about the overreach of the government in prosecuting terrorists arise, she will side with the executive. Your decision will move the court significantly to the right, and it weighs heavy on my heart.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
