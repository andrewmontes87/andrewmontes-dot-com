Mr. President, in early July, Ibrahim al-Qosi plead guilty to conspiracy with al-Qaeda and providing material support to terrorists. He was tried before a military commission rather than a normal court of law, most likely because the evidence against him was so thin. There is little proof that al-Qosi ever acted as anything more than a low-level bodyguard and cook for the al-Qaeda leadership. He is hardly the kind of terrorist kingpin the military commissions were supposedly designed to prosecute. At any rate, with his guilty plea a jury of military officers sentenced al-Qosi to 14 years. The government has been trumpeting this stiff sentence as evidence that the military commissions are serving justice to hardened terrorists.

However, it was soon reported that al-Qosi had actually agreed to a secret plea deal with prosecutors. This deal would have al-Qosi out of prison by 2012, repatriated to his home country of Sudan, where he will enter a rehabilitation program. Apparently, when the military commissions jury was instructed to deliver a sentence, they were not informed that the plea deal would take precedence.

This plea deal is sensible, as al-Qosi has already been detained for 8 years without charges. When he returns home, he will have spent almost a decade in Guantanamo, a very long time for being anybody's cook. However, the process that delivered this sentence was horribly flawed. Right from the start, al-Qosi was obviously not an important target, but he was prosecuted in controversial military commissions anyway. Then his actual sentence was kept secret so the stiffer, irrelevant sentence could be paraded around in an attempt to bolster support for the contested tribunals. It has long been evident that the entire military commissions system is fatally broken, and these recent betrayals of transparency confirm it. Terrorism suspects should be tried in a court of law, not an ad-hoc show trial where the verdict is known in advance.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
