Mr. President, climate change has become an unavoidable fact bearing down on us. At this point, most scientists say we will be unable to stop a multi-degree temperature increase that will raise sea-levels and destroy ecosystems. The result will be catastrophic for the human race, with the most damage occurring in some of the least stable parts of the world. Mass migrations and conflict are likely. Ultimately, there will be profoundly negative effects on the entire human civilization. The scale of the challenge is dizzying, but it must be faced. Though we will not escape some damage, it is imperative that we immediately begin to reduce our carbon emissions and construct an energy policy for the 21st century. We have the technology and the expertise to fully modernize industry, we lack only the will the implement it. Renewable energy is not a choice, and the sooner we realize that the better off we will be.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
