Mr. President, Labor Day is a holiday to celebrate the working class and its defenders. Throughout American history, organized labor has fought against the robber barons and crony capitalists who treat human beings like beasts of burden. In the past, labor’s achievements have included miracles such as the weekend, the 8-hour workday, and the end to child labor. These are so common sense to us today that a world without them seems cruel and pitiful. Yet they were fiercely contested every step of the way by the forces of greed. Only because the labor unions were strong did the American worker regain a shred of dignity.

Yet today, there are many in our political class who would like nothing more than to permanently dismantle organized labor, once again giving businesses free reign to abuse employees. These attacks from the regulation haters, union breakers, and entitlement slashers are designed to shift the heavy burden produced by the excess of the rich onto the backs of the working class. Even after the near collapse of the financial sector and subsequent recession, the business class and their purchased politicians continue to advocate for extreme redistribution policies aimed at funneling wealth upwards. Even the Wall Street casinos responsible for this recent economic disaster have the audacity to shriek ‘Tyranny!’ at even mild attempts to curb their gluttonous and harmful practices.

However, it was expected that big business and Republicans would continue to oppose labor. What is more dismaying is the seeming inability of Democrats to take a strong stand on labor’s behalf. Despite campaign promises, the Employee Free Choice Act, designed to make it easier to organize in part by fighting employer intimidation, has not been signed into law. The Deficit Commission, a secretive group designing proposals to shrink the deficit, is widely expected to support extensive cuts to Social Security in a report due after the midterm elections are comfortably past. Finally, even with obvious widespread support and 60 votes for confirmation, pro-labor Harvard Law professor Elizabeth Warren has yet to be named the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that she is primarily responsible for creating. Mr. President, I urge you, as leader of your party: celebrate labor all year, not just this weekend. Support stronger unions and pro-labor legislation, even in the face of political attacks. History will be on your side.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
