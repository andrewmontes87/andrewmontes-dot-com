Mr. President, the American Civil Liberties Union and Center for Constitutional Rights are in the midst of several lawsuits against the executive branch relating to the suspected terrorist and American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki. At the crux of the matter is the government's claim that is has the power to assassinate citizens anywhere in the world without judicial oversight. As an extremist cleric who advises attacks against America, al-Awlaki is a particularly unsympathetic client. He is also, however, an American citizen, and subject to the protection of the Constitution. He is entitled to due process and trial before a court of law for his crimes. Instead, the government wants to kill him, far from any battlefield.

Before the ACLU and CCR could challenge this, al-Awlaki was designated a 'global terrorist', meaning he cannot be legally represented without a special permit from the Treasury department. Until this permission was granted, any legal actions on al-Awlaki's behalf could open his lawyers to prosecution. After their request for such a permit was met with silence, the civil liberties groups were forced to file suit challenging the Treasury's permitting requirements on constitutional grounds. Suddenly, the permit was granted. The groups promise that they will continue to pursue the issue.

The government claims it has evidence that al-Awlaki is involved in operational planning of terrorist attacks, and that this justifies anything that might be done to him, citizenship or not. However, your administration still refuses to comment on the legal basis of the assassination policy, and refuses to submit the evidence against al-Awlaki to public scrutiny. To then claim that anyone who wants to challenge this needs special permission is an illegal and unconstitutional abridgment of the rights belonging to all citizens. Even after granting the permit, your administration has indicated that it will try to use arguments of state secrecy and executive authority to get the case dismissed. This is a serious assault on the principle of due process.

Anwar al-Awlaki should be in jail for his crimes. But the government should not be able to deprive him of his rights with so little oversight. Assassination programs and denial of representation are fundamentally un-American concepts, and they should not be practiced by our executive branch.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
