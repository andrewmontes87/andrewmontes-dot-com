Mr. President, in previous letters I have asked you to instigate a criminal investigation into the law-breaking of the previous administration, specifically the horrendous torture regime they implemented. In recent months, both the former president and the former vice-president have openly admitted their involvement in the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques that have traditionally been regarded as torture. Regarding waterboarding, Bush said, "I'd do it again," and Cheney has indicated that he was instrumental in initiating the policy. As far back as the Spanish-American War, American soldiers have been prosecuted for waterboarding detainees. There have been domestic torture trials for police authorities caught waterboarding prisoners. Attorney General Eric Holder has affirmed that waterboarding is torture during his confirmation hearings. The laws against torture apply even when the executive declares the detainee an 'enemy combatant' exempt from the Geneva conventions. By announcing their support for and implementation of illegal interrogation techniques, these men must know that they could be prosecuted for their crimes. Of this they show no fear; these confessions were not recorded in secret, but broadcast on national television in interviews with supposedly reputable news organizations. They speak so openly because your administration has indicated that it does not have the stomach for a torture investigation. 'Look Forward, Not Backward' is a policy of executive amnesty for war crimes. You cannot refuse your responsibility to investigate and prosecute law-breaking at the highest levels. Again, I implore you to ask Eric Holder to initiate a criminal investigation into detainee torture, aimed at the White House officials who crafted this heinous policy.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
