title: "5: No Assassination of American Citizens"

Mr. President, a few weeks ago your administration authorized operations to kill an American citizen who has never been found guilty of any crime. Anwar al-Awlaki was born in New Mexico, is a citizen of this country, and as such is provided protection by our laws and Constitution from internment or murder without being prosecuted in a court of law and found guilty by a jury of his peers. It may be true that al-Awlaki has committed terrorist crimes, as your administration has claimed. It is certainly true that he lives in hiding in Yemen, issuing exhortations to attack America - a reasonable jury would most likely find him guilty of incitement. But your administration's claims that al-Awlaki has taken part in actual planning of terrorist acts is put forward without any evidence to back it up. Without such evidence, targeting an American citizen for assassination is a chilling precedent. To date, no legal basis has been presented for this extraordinary power to kill American citizens without trials. This is unsurprising, as this policy is obviously incompatible with the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. The decision to mark al-Awlaki for death was made with no oversight and no safeguards against executive abuse. It is an intolerable infringement on the rights of citizens. If al-Awlaki is guilty of the acts he is accused of, then he should be captured and tried for his crimes. Anything less will only continue the dangerous erosion of civil liberties that has accompanied the war on terror.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
