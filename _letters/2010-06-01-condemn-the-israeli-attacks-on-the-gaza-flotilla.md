title: "16: Condemn the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla"

Mr. President, I am writing to condemn the brutal attack by the Israeli Defense Forces on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla. At this point in time, at least 9 civilians have been killed, with hundreds more detained. The ships were carrying humanitarian aid to the Palestinians living behind the Gaza blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt. Since Hamas won the 2006 elections insisted upon by the United States, the Gaza Strip has been starved of basic necessities. The economy has collapsed, and many go hungry. There is no doubt that their leaders serve them poorly when they shoot rockets into southern Israel, but all attempts to minimize Hamas have drastic effects on the civilian population. The 2008-2009 aerial bombardment and subsequent invasion left more than a thousand civilians dead, many of them children. Israel's policy towards Gaza is an international crime, and this recent attack on a civilian humanitarian mission is indicative of the depths to which the IDF will sink.

Mr. President, it is time to reconsider the United States' unconditional support of Israeli military actions. Our conduct in arming Israel with military technology and protecting it from United Nations Security Council sanctions makes us directly responsible when civilians die as a result. Unless Israel's staunchest ally and supporter makes clear that this kind of behavior is not acceptable, I fear Israel will only continue to engage in heavy-handed attacks on innocent people as it slides further away from democracy and the international community. For Israel's sake, the United States must do something to ensure this doesn't happen.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
