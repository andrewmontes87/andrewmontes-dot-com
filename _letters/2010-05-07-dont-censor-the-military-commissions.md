Mr. President, the decision to kick out 4 reporters covering the pre-trial hearing for Omar Khadr's military commission is a rash and foolhardy mistake. The 4 reporters were told they were not welcome back after they reported the name of a military interrogator. This interrogator testified that while stationed at Bagram he told Khadr, age 15, a 'fictitious story' about another young Afghan being raped. I suppose the intended effect was to scare Khadr into revealing information about al-Qaeda, but in truth it is an illegal abuse of a child soldier. Interrogator #1 gave his testimony freely, and has spoken to the media. His name is not a secret, nor the fact that he was court martialed in 2005 for his abusive behavior. This is a plainly dishonest reason for ejecting some of the finest reporters on the Guantanamo beat. The Pentagon should reconsider their banishment.

Mr. President, I do not agree with your decision to use military commissions as the venue to try suspected terrorists. But if you must use commissions, you must also abide by the ruling of the Supreme Court in Hamdam v. Rumsfeld, where the Court found that military commissions must follow certain rules to be considered valid. The current conditions of extraneous secrecy and illegitimate evidence are an affront to our nation's humanity. The expulsion of talented and diligent reporters is a further transgression against the principle of transparency. No good can come from this decision to smother the truth.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
