title: "23:  End 'No-Fly' Exile "

Mr. President, a number of citizens have been stuck in exile, banished from their own country. With no charges against them, they have been repeatedly interrogated, some abused. They are American citizens, placed on the no-fly list by our government while traveling abroad, effectively preventing them from returning home. They have been unable to argue their case or plead their innocence. Their treatment is an abomination.

One man, Yahya Wehelie, has been stranded in Egypt for six weeks because while studying in Yemen, he met another American, a man named Sharif Mobley who was eventually captured with members of al-Qaeda by Yemeni security officers. As punishment for merely meeting a man who would go on to commit crimes, Wehelie had his passport confiscated by the FBI, was pressured to take a polygraph test, and was then pressured to spy on the American Muslim community, all while being told he may never see home again. Even worse, Mr. Wehelie's 19-year-old brother Yusuf was handed over to Egyptian authorities, where he was abused and interrogated for several days. This is a continuation of the abhorrent practice of rendition practiced by the previous administration. If an American citizen can be subjected to physical abuse by a foreign interrogator without objection or protest from his government, something has gone horribly awry.

Including Mr. Wehelie and his brother, there are currently at least six people trying to return home to the United States who have been blocked by their placement on the no-fly list, a status they cannot challenge. This amounts to the use of illegal pressure tactics, and is an unconstitutional abridgment of the rights of American citizens. Americans who need to be questioned must be afforded their constitutional right to return to their country and be interrogated according to the laws of this nation.

Mr. President, the government must follow all leads when it comes to preventing terrorism. But this does not require banishment and rendition. Allow American citizens to return home, and then question them if they might know something. We cannot allow this casual dismissal of the rights of citizens to become commonplace.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
