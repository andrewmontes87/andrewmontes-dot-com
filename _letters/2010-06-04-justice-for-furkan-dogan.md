title: "18:  Justice for Furkan Dogan "

Mr. President, I am horrified by your administration's utter indifference to the death of an American citizen in the recent Gaza Freedom Flotilla massacre. 19-year-old Furkan Dogan was brutally murdered, with four bullets to the head and one to the chest, while on a humanitarian aid mission. Yet the official response has been full support for Israeli actions, even when that action kills an American citizen. I am amazed; I had thought that when American citizens were killed abroad by a foreign military, the government might express outrage and seek to bring those responsible to justice. Even worse than your administration's uncaring dismissal, there are those on the right who try to claim that Dogan was not a 'real American', and is thus undeserving of our sympathy. I can only suppose that this reasoning assumes Dogan's Turkish heritage cancels out his American citizenship. Needless to say, this sort of race-based citizenship hierarchy would be an abhorrent addition to our democracy. I do not accuse you of subscribing to this regressive ideology. In truth, I suspect your restrained response is due not to the identity of the victim, but of the perpetrators. If Iran had boarded a ship delivering humanitarian aid in international waters and killed an American citizen, the response would have been immediate and harsh. When Israel does the same, suddenly that citizen is somehow responsible for his own death. Mr. President, you must demand accountability for the death of Furkan Dogan, and insist on an independent investigation into the massacre. The current attitude of disinterest is unsatisfactory.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
