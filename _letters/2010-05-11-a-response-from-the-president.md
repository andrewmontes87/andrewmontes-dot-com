Dear Andrew Montes:

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with me. I value your comments and inquiries.

I greatly appreciate the outpouring of messages from Americans across the country and around the world. Some comments are supportive, others are critical, but all reflect the desire of Americans to participate in a dialogue about our common concerns and challenges.

To learn more about my Administration or to contact me in the future, please visit www.WhiteHouse.gov. Thank you again for writing.


Sincerely,

Barack Obama
