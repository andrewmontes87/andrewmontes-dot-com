Mr. President, in the past you have spoken fiercely against the previous administration's detention policies, codified in the odious Military Commissions Act of 2006. You called the prison at Guantanamo Bay a "legal black hole", and when the Supreme Court, in Boumediene v. Bush, held that the detainees imprisoned there were entitled to habeas corpus rights, you celebrated the decision, praising the court for "rejecting a false choice between fighting terrorism and respecting habeas corpus." Out of 48 hearings that have been brought since the 2008 ruling, 35 were won by the defendants due to lack of evidence against them.

Apparently things have changed. A few weeks ago the DC Circuit Court overturned a lower court opinion that had extended habeas rights to detainees captured outside of Afghanistan and held at Bagram Theater Internment Facility. The Circuit Court found for the government, who argued that denying habeas to two Yemenis and a Tunisian captured outside Afghanistan then taken to Bagram for interrogation and indefinite detention was necessary because of the 'pragmatic obstacles' involved in giving hearings in a war zone. These men contend that they are not terrorists, but they have been given no venue to challenge the evidence against them. It appears they will not get one, unless this decision is overturned by the Supreme Court.

Bagram is now a legal black hole for the current administration. The government can snatch people from wherever they want and drop them in a Constitution-free cage with no way to prove their innocence. According to the LA Times, your administration plans on retaining control of the prison in Bagram for the express reason of using it as a neo-Guantanamo. Of course, this would open the door to further legal challenges, as the recent decision specifically stated that evidence of such manipulation would counteract the logic behind "pragmatic obstacles". Why do we need a special prison in a distant country without legal oversight or protection from abusive interrogation? This will undermine our efforts to win over local populations and strengthen the national government, while contributing to jihadi propaganda that depicts the US as an aggressor against Islam. If prisoners are flown in from around the world to be subjected to the abusive treatment reported to be occurring in the secret 'Black Prison' at Bagram, how is this different from George W. Bush and the horrible crime of Guantamo?

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
