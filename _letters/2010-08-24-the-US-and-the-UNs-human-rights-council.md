title: "35:  The U.S. and the UN's Human Rights Council"

Mr. President, for years the US government refused to engage with the UN's Human Rights Council. Nations are asked for periodic reports that illustrate their domestic efforts to ensure human rights are respected within their own borders. Yesterday, your administration made history: the very first American report was submitted to the UN.

The US has always made strong rhetorical commitments to the principle of universal human rights, but the government's behavior has not always lived up to that high standard. Certainly it has rarely been willing to acknowledge the legitimacy of international authority to regulate its behavior. The decision to submit a report on internal human rights conditions is a welcome step towards ending this hurtful isolation.

The report finds that racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia continue to constitute serious threats to human rights in America. One only needs to look to the recent controversy over the Park51 community center to see the extent that bigotry and intolerance have embedded themselves in our culture and politicians. Respect for human rights requires us to fight back against these odious attempts at oppression with all our might, and I am glad the periodic report acknowledges that.

The report is not wholly commendable, however. Several key issues are ignored, most notably those surrounding detention and incarceration. The US is the world leader in domestic incarceration: an astounding 1 out of every 100 Americans is in the vast prison-industrial system. Prison conditions remain consistently overcrowded and inhumane. Things are worse for immigrants, where the detention system is arbitrary, cruel, and denial of legal representation is par for the course. Finally, there are the prisons for those detained in the war on terror. Guantanamo is not only open 9 months after its promised closing date, it is hosting an irregular military tribunal designed to guarantee a conviction against a child soldier who was tortured. Indefinite detention and ad-hoc kangaroo courts do not demonstrate a commitment to human rights.

The decision to release this report is laudable, and the issues it raises are serious. However, it did not fully describe the extent of human rights abuses in America. There is still work to be done, and your administration should continue to work with all relevant parties to improve human rights at home.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
