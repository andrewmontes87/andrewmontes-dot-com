Mr. President,

On Sep. 21st, the Justice Department released a report detailing abusive investigations by the FBI into peaceful advocacy groups during the Bush administration. The report found that anti-war and environmental groups and activists were subjected to “improper” surveillance, put on terrorist watch lists, and harassed “without adequate basis” for “factually weak” reasons. Among the groups targeted were Greenpeace, PETA, and the Thomas Merton Center, all left-leaning organizations opposed to President Bush’s foreign and domestic policies. It seems clear that the FBI was conducting a concerted surveillance program on the White House’s political adversaries, resurrecting the infamous COINTELPRO practices for the post-9/11 era.

However, the Justice Department decided to shield this odious behavior by explicitly declaring that these groups were NOT targeted for First Amendment reasons. Instead, the report says that despite being wrongfully initiated and prolonged without reason, these investigations were justified because FBI agents believed the groups “might” commit terrorism. This defense is a weak attempt to whitewash obvious governmental malfeasance, and is yet another example of the Justice Department covering up Bush scandals.

Why would the Department of Justice be reluctant to criticize the FBI for persecuting activists? A clue came just three days after this report was released. On Sep. 24th, the FBI raided the homes of numerous anti-war activists in Minneapolis and Chicago. Again, the investigation was based on the suspicion that these groups “might” be materially supporting terrorism. However, none of the activists are guilty of anything but political advocacy. The prosecution of advocacy has been a threat since the Supreme Court’s misguided decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project vastly broadened the definition of ‘material support’ to include mere contact or communication. Indeed, some of the people being investigated have met with members of the FARC or PLFP in their capacity as labor organizers or peace activists. But this disturbing conflation of advocacy and material support has opened the door to a reprisal of the “improper” investigations disparaged in the aforementioned report.

In hindsight, the inescapable conclusion is that the Justice Department dodged its responsibility and exonerated the FBI’s actions because it knew that similar investigations were still ongoing. The extreme politicization of executive agencies was one of the most insidious aspects of the Bush administration, leading to numerous scandals and indictments. Such a dismissive attitude towards the First Amendment is not befitting a President educated in Constitutional law. The FBI should cease these misguided attempts to silence political speech.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
