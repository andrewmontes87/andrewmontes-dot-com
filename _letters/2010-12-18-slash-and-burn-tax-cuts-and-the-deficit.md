title: "46:  Slash and Burn: Tax Cuts and the Deficit"

Mr. President,

The impending 'tax cut deal' extending the Bush handouts to the richest Americans is a betrayal of your campaign promises. There is very little economic stimulus in tax breaks for billionaires, who will simply save the extra money. Tax rates for the obscenely wealthy are at historic lows, and the increased revenue could have been used to stimulate the depressed economy. Contrary to conservative claims, taxing the rich will not slow the economic recovery; instead, it would help fund the government programs people depend on to get by in rough times.

If a depression is a bad time to hand out tax breaks to the upper crust, it is an even worse time to make deep cuts to public spending. The growth of the federal deficit is a problem, but not an immediate one. Nevertheless, your administration's bipartisan Deficit Commission has endorsed slashing entitlement spending. Cutting government programs like food stamps, unemployment benefits, Social Security and Medicare would remove an important source of relief for Americans in need. Republicans never worry about the deficit when it comes to paying for their wars, only when it comes to caring for the sick and poor. Social Security and Medicare are two of the most popular government programs of all time. Defend them vigorously, fund them fully.

But Republicans will cry, we can't afford this! The answer is that we could if the wealthy would pay their fair share. The best way to stimulate the economic recovery is to lower taxes on the first $20,000 of income, and increase taxes on all income over $250,000. This would put money back in the pocket of those who need it most, work towards reducing the deficit, and force the rich to help shoulder the burden of the recovery.

By acquiescing to an extension of the Bush tax cuts for billionaires and preparing the groundwork for drastic reductions to the social safety net, your administration has shown its willingness to concede ground to the Republican rhetorical discourse of 'Slash and Burn', demonizing public spending. This attitude will prolong the depression and hurt ordinary people. The rich, meanwhile, are laughing all the way to the bank.

Sincerely, 

Andrew Montes
