Mr. President,

On Friday, you signed a defense appropriations bill, H.R. 6523, the “Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011.” This kind of signing is a relatively common occurrence in the White House, where more money is constantly needed for national security. But H.R. 6523 was different. In this bill, Congress specifically prohibited the executive branch from transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US mainland for any reason. This effectively blocks the use of federal courts for terrorism trials, and ensures further imprisonment without charge for the people held there.

This is a shocking development. The prison at Guantanamo Bay is internationally recognized as a symbol of American torture and lawbreaking. In the 2008 presidential election campaign, both yourself and Sen. McCain promised to close the prison. Yet more than two years later it is still open, still housing detainees who were tortured in the early years of the last administration. That Congress would actively work to prevent this national wound from healing is unconscionable.

The statement accompanying your signature suggests that you are similarly outraged. The signing statement calls the offending provisions “a dangerous and unprecedented challenge to critical executive branch authority” and says that your administration “will work with the Congress to seek repeal of these restrictions”. However, you signed the bill “because of the importance of authorizing appropriations for, among other things, our military activities in 2011.”

If you truly disapproved of these conditions, you could have vetoed the bill. The threat that our military would ‘run out of money’ is patently false. Congress is directly encroaching on the prosecutorial discretion of the executive branch, in flagrant disregard for the balance of power demanded by the Constitution. Furthermore, there is the issue that this bill amounts to an unconstitutional bill of attainder. Congress is not allowed to pass legislation specifically targeting certain individuals. But most importantly, by prohibiting the use of federal courts, Congress has left the discredited military tribunals as the only option for the prosecution of terrorist suspects. Your signing statement defended the idea of terrorist prosecutions in federal courts, but a stronger statement would have been to veto the bill that blocked them.

The implication is that your administration is simply not committed to the use of Article III courts. Neither is there much enthusiasm for their highly flawed counterparts, the military commissions. Indeed, according to the Washington Post, holding people indefinitely without any trial at all seems to be the preferred option at this time. In an article late last year, the paper reported that your administration plans to issue an executive order implementing a policy of indefinite detention. The executive order would create a framework wherein detainees would be held indefinitely but have their case periodically reviewed by a ‘parole board’ of military officers and government officials. The detainee would have access to the lawyer, but ultimately the board would be measuring a level of supposed threat, not guilt.

Regardless of legality, indefinite detention has been a fact of life for Guantanamo detainees for many years now. This plan, supporters argue, would at least bring some much-needed order and transparency to what has been a dirty de-facto policy. Besides, there are very real fears that the new Congress intends to revisit the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force - the legal foundation of the entire war on terror - and vastly expand it to endorse a hideous new era of forever, wherever war. Creating a system of indefinite detention by presidential fiat may smack of the unitary executive so cherished by the last administration, but it might be preferable to the monster a Republican Congress would birth.

While these arguments may be politically appealing, they do not have any legal merit. Holding people without charges for years on end is plainly unconstitutional, and even more plainly immoral. This proposed executive order is the proverbial lipstick on the pig. People suspected of terrorism should be tried in federal courts, not indefinitely detained. Of course, Congress recently prohibited the trial option, and you declined to veto. Perhaps the detainees at Guantanamo Bay will have a chance to have their cases heard by the next administration.

To clarify, we are talking about approximately 48 individuals, out of the 174 total still housed at the prison, who would be subject to this new order. The main reason these detainees cannot be charged with crimes or released to their homes is the torture and abuse they received during the Bush administration. Faced with tainted evidence, a jury might be forced to acquit even a hardened terrorist, as demonstrated by the recent struggle to convict Ahmed Ghailani. Others are held even though they are known to be innocent because the security situation in their home countries is deemed too ‘unstable’. There are always plenty of excuses to allow the tremendous inertia of the whole horrible apparatus to slouch onwards.

But it’s not going to get any easier. Guantanamo Bay continues to erode our international reputation and inspire new generations of terrorists. The people housed there continue to be denied due process. And the domestic political elite seem to grow ever fonder of our American gulag. In truth, I worry that I will be writing this same letter in a decade’s time. The time to close the prison is now.

Sincerely, 

Andrew Montes
