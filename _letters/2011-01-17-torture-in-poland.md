Mr. President,

The Polish Press Agency has reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is officially refusing to provide assistance to Warsaw prosecutors investigating a CIA black site in northeastern Poland. This is yet another example of the American government attempting to block investigations into the torture regime of the last decade. According to the report, U.S. authorities consider the matter “to be closed.”

The available evidence proves that a secret base outside the village of Stare Kiejkuty was used to detain and torture terrorist suspects in the early years of the war on terror. In February 2010, the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency released flight logs describing a fleet of CIA ‘ghost planes’ that used the nearby Szymany Airport multiple times to render detainees to the Stare Kiejkuty black site. These planes, arriving from Kabul and Rabat under false flight plans, carried ‘high-value detainees’ who were going to be tortured. Some notable visitors include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was tortured with waterboarding 183 times over the course of two weeks at the base, and Abu Zubaydah, who was subjected to torture so severe that the organization Physicians for Human Rights has called it ‘human experimentation’.

The Szymany airstrip has sordid history. It was used by the occupying German Luftwaffe for bombing runs on Warsaw in World War II, and later used by the occupying Soviet Union to plan the military repression of the Prague Spring in 1968. To this, we can add American torture chamber. Apparently, the location was chosen with the consent of Polish intelligence officials, who were eager to cooperate. At the heart of the current investigation is exactly how much the Polish government knew about the illegal interrogations taking place inside the base. If high-level authorities were aware of the nature and extent of the abuse occurring, they would be complicit and subject to prosecution under Polish and international law. So far, former president Aleksander Kwaśniewski and former prime minister Leszek Miller have denied all knowledge of a CIA black site in Poland, but the documents released since have cast doubts on their claims. 

Your administration is now not only blocking domestic investigations, but foreign ones as well. The refusal of the Department of Justice to assist Warsaw prosecutors in their search for the truth shows the hypocrisy of Washington rhetoric pledging fealty to the rule of law. That the Polish nation is attempting to investigate their complicity in torture is admirable; that they should be thwarted by the American government is despicable, but not surprising. In direct defiance of treaty obligations your administration has refused to assist international investigations of U.S. crimes in Spain, Germany, Italy, and now Poland. For the rule of law to mean anything, there must be consequences for law-breaking at the highest levels of government. Officials who collaborated in torture and abuse must be held accountable.

Sincerely, 

Andrew Montes
