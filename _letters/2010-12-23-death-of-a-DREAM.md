Mr. President,

On Saturday, the Senate voted 55-41 in favor of the DREAM Act. It is a testament to the popularity of the DREAM Act that the legislation could receive majority support in this fractured and partisan Congress. But because of arcane Congressional rules, the measure has failed, and innocent young Americans are suffering.

The legislation would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who arrived before the age of 16 and go to college or join the armed forces. Many of these young people have been in the United States their whole lives. But they are forced to live in the shadows, ever fearful of being deported from their home. The DREAM Act was designed to help these young people step out into the light. By attending college or joining the armed forces, undocumented youth could gain American citizenship. We must act, because the current situation is inhumane and untenable. Young people ought not to be punished for being brought to this country through no choice of their own.

41 Senators voted against cloture. Most were Republicans, which is unsurprising. Even the fact that the bill would have cut the budget deficit by $2.2 billion over the next 10 year was not enough to move them from their bigoted and racist anti-immigrant positions. But the true failure of the bill can be blamed on your party, Mr. President. Sens. Max Baucus, Jon Tester, Kay Hagan, Ben Nelson, and Mark Pryor, all Democrats, joined the opposition to filibuster the DREAM Act. Because of their political desire to appear 'centrist', they have literally killed the dreams of hundreds of thousands of oppressed young Americans.

In defense of the DREAM Act, you once said of the young people it seeks to protect, “Our nation is enriched by their talents and would benefit from the success of their efforts.” In turn, this legislation would have benefited from the success of your efforts to ensure its passage. You claimed to cherish the DREAM Act, and yet Senators from your own party have scuttled the bill. How can we ever imagine taking on comprehensive immigration reform if we can't even pass something as politically appealing as the DREAM Act?

As the leader of the Democratic party, you are ultimately responsible for the failure of this important legislation due to obstruction from Democratic Senators. With every delay, young Americans must huddle in the shadows, denied the right to fully realize their dreams and contribute to their communities. Their lives are not pawns on a political chessboard, waiting to be strategically sacrificed. It is time to fulfill your duty to them, reign in your party, and ensure the passage of the DREAM Act.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
