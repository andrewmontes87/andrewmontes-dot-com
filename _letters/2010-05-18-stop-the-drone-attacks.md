Mr. President, the Pashtun tribes of southern Afghanistan and the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan have been under increasing pressure from United States forces. The surge of troops to Afghanistan, coupled with military pushes in Marja and soon Kandahar, are an example. These actions have had limited success, but they are at least taken in concert with our allies and place a high priority on protecting civilians. More chilling is the ever-increasing use of unmanned drones to kill scores of people at once, far from any battlefield. The names used for these machines are quite frightening: Predator, Reaper, Hellfire. They hover high above Afghani and Pakistani villages, while the pilot operates it from a base in Virginia, Nevada, or California. Often they are flown by contractors. When ordered to fire, they unleash a barrage of missiles that leave few survivors. There is nothing wrong in theory with using new technologies to fight war more effectively. But today, these technologies are being used to slaughter civilians. The problem for the drone operator is that his only viewpoint is from thousands of feet in the air. This leaves local intelligence as the main determiner on targets, local intelligence that is also collected mainly through contractors. The sad but unsurprising consequence is that many strikes kill innocent people, while the Taliban network is left strengthened by the resulting rage of the population. When the strike does succeed in eliminating a terrorist operative, the cost in public support is still high. Faisal Shahzad, the American who attempted to detonate a car bomb in Times Square, admitted to interrogators that he was driven partly by anger over these drone strikes. Over ninety percent of the Pakistani people disapprove of the United States' missile strikes in their country. Indeed, we have no legal right to attack these areas. Even the extreme notion that 'the whole world is the battlefield' does not mean the US military can lob bombs into any country we choose. We should be wary of setting a precedent of remotely assassinating enemies of the state; this technology is not so complex that other nations will not have it soon. Mr. President, I understand the need to disrupt terrorist networks. But using a tool that kills civilians, inflames public opinion, and is of dubious legality is not the way to do so. A plan of political and economic engagement would do far more to guarantee our nation's safety.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
