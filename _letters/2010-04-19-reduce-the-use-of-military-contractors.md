title: "4: Reduce the Use of Military Contractors "

Mr. President, a few days ago General Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, gave statements to the effect that he believes it would be prudent to reduce the number of private-sector military contractors operating in the war zone. I strongly agree with his sentiments. The increased use of security contractors in Iraq lead to catastrophes like the Sept 2007 shootings in Baghdad by Blackwater employees. Blackwater was eventually banned from operating in Iraq by their government, but the company has re-branded itself as Xe and today bids for a contract training Afghani police forces. These outbursts of violence indicate that private military companies are not properly trained for a mission that requires minimizing civilian casualties and winning hearts and minds.

Similarly disturbing is the lack of accountability the contractors enjoy. Despite countless accusations of waste and fraud committed by contractors, and acknowledgment from the military that over-dependence on these groups is expensive and ineffective, there have been virtually no investigation into possible criminal activity. Private military companies are provided with immunity and protected from prosecution. Particularly egregious examples include the horrifying cases of Jamie Leigh Jones, Dawn Leamon, and Mary Beth Kineston. These women were sexually assaulted while employees of KBR, and to date there have been no prosecutions. The failure to even investigate these attacks reflects very badly on the Justice Department.

Using private-sector military contractors is a wasteful and counter-productive strategy. Though the military will likely never be completely free of their influence (as the alternative, a drastic increase in the size of the military, is not a palatable choice), it is imperative that we limit the damage then can do. Contractors must be accorded the strictest oversight, with prosecutions for misconduct and attention to wasteful spending. In areas of security, contractors should be banned. There is every evidence that security contractors do a worse job for more money. Security should be the sole concern of the military.

Sincerely, 

Andrew Montes
