title: "9:  May Day - International Workers' Day "

Mr. President, today is May 1st, a holiday observed around the world as a celebration of the men and women who keep things working in our industrial society. Historically, labor rights have had to be earned with blood and sweat, wrenched from the oppressive business barons. It is hard today to imagine a world without weekends, with 16-hour work days, with child labor, yet these were once common. Unfortunately, the business class and its allies in Congress continue to oppose labor and fight regulation. I strongly support unions and other labor organizations in their fight for fair treatment. To this end, I urge you to stay steadfast in your support for the Employee Free Choice Act. This bill should become law. I would also encourage you to declare Election Day to be a national holiday. Nothing would empower the average working person more than the guaranteed ability to exercise his or her democratic rights. The current situation, in which many of our poorest citizens do not vote because they have to go to work, creates large-scale disenfranchisement. Making Election Day a civic holiday could only strengthen our democracy.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
