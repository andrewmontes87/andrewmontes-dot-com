title: "17: British Torture Investigation"

Mr. President, a few weeks ago the new U.K. government announced that a judge will investigate the claims that detainees were tortured while in custody. This investigation is designed not only to shed light on criminal activity, but to expose high-level officials who colluded in torture. Full details on the inquiry are not yet available, so there are still questions of transparency and immunity. Still, this is an admirable step towards healing the wounds caused by the reckless use of torture by powerful officials.

The obvious question, when hearing about an investigation of this sort, is why do we not yet have a similar one here? We know for a fact that detainees were tortured, and we know that White House officials were involved in the abuse. Where is Eric Holder's criminal investigation? I applaud the U.K. for attempting to fully purge itself of the disease of torture, but the sickness originated in the U.S. We have a responsibility to examine our conduct and punish those who committed terrible crimes. The use of torture in interrogations is a potent talking point used by radicals to sway populations against us. When announcing the investigation, Foreign Secretary William Hague said to reporters, "Until the full facts are known, Britain's name and reputation will be dragged through the mud – not least by the terrorists and extremists who will exploit these allegations for their own propaganda... It is vital to remember that torture does not help us defeat terrorists; it helps them to try to justify their hostility to us." Unless we show that we truly are a nation of laws, not men, our attempts to win 'hearts and minds' in Islamic populations will go nowhere. I strongly urge you to ask the Attorney General to instigate a criminal investigation of torture, focusing on the high-level officials who authorized it.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
