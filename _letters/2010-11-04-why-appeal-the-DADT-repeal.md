title: "42:  Why Appeal the DADT Repeal?"

Mr. President,

The ban on gays and lesbians serving in the armed forces has long been a violation of human rights. As President, you have acknowledged the fundamentally unjust nature of the 17-year-old ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ (DADT) law, which forces gay and lesbian servicemembers to hide their sexual orientation or face being discharged from their careers. Your administration has promised that this law will be repealed by the end of your first term.

A recent case in the central district of California had finally achieved this goal. On Sep. 9th, in the case of Log Cabin Republicans v. the United States of America, Judge Virginia A. Phillip ruled that DADT violated the constitutional rights of gay and lesbian servicemembers. Specifically, the law violates their 5th amendment rights to due process and their 1st amendment rights to freedom of speech. As a result of this ruling, on Oct. 12th Judge Phillip issued a permanent worldwide injunction barring the Department of Defense from enforcing DADT. The Pentagon quickly complied, announcing that it would finally accept openly gay recruits. It was a moment to celebrate.

So why, if your administration is so committed to repealing this law, has the Department of Justice appealed the decision and requested an emergency stay of Judge Phillip’s injunction? DADT destroys lives and lowers the effectiveness of our armed forces. But when offered the perfect chance to do away with this crazy injustice forever, your administration decided to actively defend a policy you disparage in public. Now the appeals court has granted your request for a stay, and once again the thousands of gay and lesbian soldiers that risk their lives for this country must keep silent about their identities.

The decision to appeal and reinstate DADT cannot be reconciled with your opposition to the ban. The reasons you have given to explain your actions - that you would prefer a legislative solution, that the Justice Department is obligated to defend even the most heinous of congress’s laws - do not hold up under scrutiny. The ‘obligation to defend’ is not ironclad, and there is ample precedent to refuse to defend an odious and oppressive law, especially one already deemed unconstitutional by a district judge. As for the Senate’s filibuster of the DADT repeal, the bigotry of a political party is no reason to deny basic human rights to American citizens. It was good and just that this law fell, and Judge Phillips made a wise decision. That you decided to reverse course is mystifying.

Mr. President, if you have good reasons to appeal Judge Phillip’s injunction, you should share them with the public. If you actually prefer to keep the ban on gay and lesbian servicemembers in place, you should come clean. But this dishonest approach, attacking the policy in stump speeches and defending it in court, leaves your supporters disillusioned and your servicemembers in pain. Equal rights cannot be sacrificed to ‘political realities’. ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ should be repealed.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
