Mr. President, in Boumediene v. Bush the Supreme Court found that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay are entitled to habeas corpus review. If the executive wants to avoid a trial in federal courts for reasons of security or expediency and seeks to use a military commission instead, the government has the responsibility of ensuring that the system provides prisoners with a way to challenge the evidence against them. As a candidate, you acknowledged that military commissions were the wrong way to prosecute suspected terrorists. But in 2009, you reversed yourself, giving new life to the commissions. You promised to clean them up, and disallow evidence that was coerced. Let us be clear: we are talking about torture. Competent interrogation experts have long known that abusive interrogations are nearly useless for producing evidence, as those being tortured will say anything to make the pain stop. Likewise, confessions made under duress have never been recognized as legitimate. If military commissions are to have even a shred of legitimacy, they must not allow people to be convicted based on statements made after torture.

The opening steps of the military commission of Omar Khadr are getting underway in Guantanamo Bay. This is a camp you promised would be closed months ago. Instead, a kangaroo court will seek to silence a man who has been held without trial for more than seven years. Nobody should be executed or imprisoned for life based on evidence procured under torture. I hope that the judge understands this very simple fact of American jurisprudence. It is ominous that the Manual for the Military Commissions Act of 2009 was signed only today, and as of yet there is no copy of the manual at Guantanamo Bay. I fail to see how this form of ad hoc justice can be reconciled with your personal ideals and the liberties that underly our nation.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
