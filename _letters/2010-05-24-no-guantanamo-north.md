Mr. President, I am writing in opposition to your plan to close Guantanamo Bay. These are difficult words to write, as 'Gitmo' is a symbol of the crimes committed by the previous administration. This is a camp where men, many innocent, were tortured and held for years without trial. The camp is used in enemy propaganda to justify terrorist attacks. It should be closed, and you have promised to do so. However, the plan to move detainees to a facility in Illinois is unacceptable if it exists in the same legal black hole that made Guantanamo infamous. Closing Guantanamo cannot mean moving military commissions and indefinite detention without trial to American soil. Civil liberties organizations, including Physicians for Human Rights and the ACLU, oppose the plan dubbed 'Guantanamo North'. The prison was hated for the law-breaking and abuse that occurred there, and a change of scenery will not resolve anything.

I do not agree with the use of military commissions to try people like Omar Khadr, a child soldier facing war crimes charges for a traditional battlefield act. I do not agree with the indefinite detention of 48 people. I do not agree with abusive interrogations in secret prisons. The rule of law prohibits us from using such ad-hoc methods of imprisonment. More important than the illegality of these practices is their immorality. I cannot endorse the closing of Guantanamo if these horrifying crimes are brought home.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
