title: "A Question for Congressman Kucinich "

Congressman Kucinich, after campaigning on a platform of civil liberties and a new way forward in combating terrorism, the Obama administration has shown a clear lack of interest in rolling back the executive overreaches of the last decade. Guantanamo is not closed, and there are accusations of a new secret prison at Bagram. The President has authorized the assassination of an American citizen, is using irregular tribunals to try child soldiers, and has dramatically escalated the potentially illegal drone war in Pakistan. These policies are in effect a full-hearted embrace of the Bush administration's radical theory of the unitary executive. However, while Bush's transgressions were loudly denounced by the institutional left, today we find few Democratic voices willing to criticize the president for flip-flopping on executive power. You are one of the few Congressional Democrats who have put forward bills aimed at limiting those powers; sadly, your colleagues seem uninterested in supporting them. It is the job of Congress and the Courts to serve as a balance to an executive intent on overstepping his bounds, but neither has made a bold stand. In an era where the president is viewed as a benevolent protector of the nation who must have extensive power to keep us safe, what is the best way to pressure the President and reluctant Democrats that these powers represent a significant danger to our democracy?

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
