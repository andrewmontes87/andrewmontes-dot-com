title: "2: A Liberal Supreme Court Nominee"

Mr. President, I'm writing concerning the imminent vacancy on the Supreme Court, and the importance of picking a nominee that with views similar to the departing Justice Stevens. Justice Stevens watched the Court move so far to the right that he went from being at the center to the leader of the progressive wing. His passionate endorsements of revered liberal principles in all areas of the law were a desperately-needed counterbalance to the extremism of the Bush Administration. His successor must have similar views.

Unfortunately, the evidence available indicates that Elena Kagan is significantly to the right of Justice Stevens on several issues, most notably on questions of executive overreach. In cases such as Rasul v. Bush and Boumedienne v. Bush, Justice Stevens made a stand against illegal detainment policies by explicitly rejecting the theory that either the AUMF or the Constitution give the executive unlimited power. The nation deserves that his successor be equally committed to civil liberties. As currently pending cases like Rasul v. Rumsfeld, suing on the basis of illegal treatment as a detainee, seem likely to make their way to the Supreme Court, the new Justice will almost certainly be confronted with these questions. Elena Kagan has shown absolutely no indication that she embraces the philosophies of Justice Stevens in areas of presidential power. She is undoubtedly an intelligent and qualified woman, but this is not sufficient when choosing a nominee for an office that holds such sway. When there are so many obviously superior candidates (such as Diane Wood, Harold Koh, or Pam Karlan), the selection of Elena Kagan could only serve to continue the Court's long-term rightward slide.

Mr. President, as a candidate for office you firmly denounced the Bush administration's unconstitutional and illegal policies. It is extremely important that you select a Supreme Court nominee that reflects these views. I implore you to reject Elena Kagan as that nominee.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
