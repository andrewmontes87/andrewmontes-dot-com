Mr. President, on July 13th there were two substantial legal developments concerning the prosecution of suspected terrorists. The first was positive, a step forward for human rights, as Mohammed Hassan Odaini was finally repatriated to his home country of Yemen. Mistakenly arrested in 2001 by Pakistani authorities and handed over to the US government, Odaini spent 8 years, from age 18 to 26, at Guantanamo Bay. This is despite the fact that the government came to the realization that he was innocent quite early, as far back as 2002. However, neither the Bush administration nor the current Justice Department seemed interested in letting a man they knew to be innocent go free. Prosecutors consistently argued that he had ties to al-Qaeda, but had no evidence to support this accusation. Finally, in a secret ruling on May 26th 2010, District Judge Henry H. Kennedy, Jr. of the DC District Court ordered Odaini released, finding that the government had seriously distorted the evidence against him. His repatriation was the first exception to the blanket ban on releasing detainees to Yemen, even if they are known to be innocent, and it is not likely to be the last. The behavior of the Justice Department in holding this innocent man for 8 years without charges is despicable, and Odaini's freedom should be celebrated.

The second development of July 13th is less laudable. In the case of Mohammed al-Adahi, an appeals court overturned a previous order releasing him and in doing so greatly expanded the ability of the Executive to indefinitely detain people based on circumstantial evidence. Al-Adahi had tenuous family ties to al-Qaeda; he admitted meeting Osama bin-Laden at a wedding, and said he had attended the al-Farouq training camp before being expelled for breaking strict Sharia rules by smoking. In August 2009, DC District Judge Gladys Kessler ordered him released, arguing that none of the suspicious indicators amounted to proof of membership in al-Qaeda or engagement in terrorist activity. It was this decision that the appeals court overturned 3-0, arguing that taken together, multiple suspicious indicators are enough to imprison somebody for years on end. This is a vast difference from the original 'preponderance of the evidence' standard set by Senior District Judge Thomas F. Hogan after the Boumedienne v. Bush decision extended habeas rights to Guantanamo detainees in November 2008. Even more disturbing is the fact that several of the 'suspicious indicators' were just executive reports urging more investigation, so that in a Kafka-esque maneuver the accusations were transformed into the evidence. Ultimately, this decision opens the door to the continued indefinite detention of people solely on the basis of speculative accusations.

It is interesting that in both the Odaini and al-Adahi cases, while the Justice Department argued for indefinite detention without trial, it abandoned the Bush regime's theory that Article II of the Constitution conferred the President with almost limitless legal power; instead, it has embraced the critically flawed 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force as justification. However, the AUMF was an incredibly vague piece of legislation that has been invoked to justify behavior that is clearly illegal and unconstitutional. Using a different rationale does not change the fact that in terms of detaining terrorism suspects, your administration has continued to embrace Bush-era policies and legal justifications. This is a betrayal of the promises you made as a candidate, and in your initial acts as President ordering the closure of Guantanamo and the cessation of the flawed military commissions. The Justice Department cannot continue to prosecute innocent people and justify indefinite detentions forever without becoming irredeemably corrupted. The indefinite detention regime should be dismantled, not enshrined as a new bipartisan consensus.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
