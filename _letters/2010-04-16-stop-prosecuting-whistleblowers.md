title: "1: Stop Prosecuting Whistleblowers"

Mr. President, I am writing to strenuously object to the current efforts to prosecute whistleblowers. The announcement that Thomas Drake will be prosecuted for his brave attempts to expose criminal behavior will serve to dissuade others with damning information from coming forward and shedding light on illegal actions undertaken by the government. It is morally appalling that of all the countless crimes committed by the Federal Government during the Bush Administration, including torture and falsifying evidence to lead us into war, the sole prosecution that has emerged is directed against an individual who had the courage to alert the public to crime and fraud within their elected government. The warrantless surveillance that the NSA engaged in is the crime - whistleblowing is not. It is unconscionable that your stated philosophy of 'Look Forward, Not Back' should apply to Dick Cheney but not to Thomas Drake.

Mr. President, it is possible your advisers insist that for Democrats to get elected they must have a Republican foreign policy. It is possible they are right. This does not absolve you of the moral responsibility to uphold one of the most cherished principles of our country: that the government is accountable to the people, and that crimes committed at the highest level will be accorded the strictest scrutiny. Your progressive supporters have seen much to appreciate in your policies. But your insistence on embracing Bush principles (like state secrecy) and protecting Bush officials (except whistleblowers) is a tremendous blow to the integrity of our nation. I beg of you, do the right thing. Drop this wrongheaded persecution of Thomas Drake, and begin an independent investigation of lawbreaking in the previous administration. The soul of the country you swore to protect requires nothing less.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
