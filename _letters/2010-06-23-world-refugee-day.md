Mr. President, World Refugee Day was June 20th. The recent disturbing rise in refugees is partially due to armed conflict, but the problem is displacement, regardless of cause. People are wrenched from their lives not just by conflict but also by natural disasters, development projects, a capricious global economy, and climate change. After losing their possessions or even family members, refugees suffer discrimination in exile, including forced return, arbitrary arrest, restricted freedom of movement, and violation of social and economic rights. Internally displaced people are worse off than those who cross borders, as they are not entitled to official 'refugee' status and assistance from the UN, while still facing discrimination and loss of livelihood. The problems do not disappear with repatriation, as without a concerted effort at disarmament and reintegration of returnees, social fissures can remain.

Some refugee situations are improving, including crises in Burundi, Angola, and Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, others are deteriorating, such as Pakistan, Palestine, Somalia, and Burma. Recently Kyrgyzstan joined this tragic group. If refugees are ignored, protracted situations can fester for decades, as evidenced by Columbia, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, and Eritrea. Finally, there are the most disturbing crises - the ones for which the United States military bears direct responsibility. There are approximately 5 million displaced Iraqis and over 3 million displaced Afghanis. We must acknowledge our role in propagating these humanitarian disasters.

There are several steps that your administration could take that would immediately improve the Iraqi and Afghani refugee crises. First, the number of Iraqi and Afghani refugees admitted into the United States should be vastly increased. More broadly, we should begin to withdraw our troops from both Iraq and Afghanistan, as their presence often draws violence and worsens the situation. Finally, you should encourage Congress to pass S. 3113, the Refugee Protection Act of 2010. This important legislation will help protect refugees and asylum seekers.

Mr. President, we owe a debt to those whose lives we have uprooted. To quote Arthur Helton, refugees are a product of humanities worst instincts, but our response to their plight can be a product of humanities best instincts. It is our responsibility to ensure that our conduct upholds the latter.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
