Mr. President, I hope that you had a pleasant 4th of July weekend. Independence Day is a time to celebrate the ideals that underpin our nation, and the good around the world that has been achieved in their name. In my eyes, the most important part about being an American is the implicit social contract. To be an American is not to have been born in a certain place to a certain people, but is instead to embrace an ethos of liberty and respect for our fellow human beings. Our great national documents, like the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, demonstrate the extent to which the American identity is placed in philosophical principles. Our history books are lined with a continuous struggle for freedom from tyranny and oppression. Democracy, human rights, free speech, care for the poor; I see these beliefs ingrained in our culture. This identity insists on fealty to these ideals, encouraged by a strong belief in continuous self-improvement widespread in American society.

What is most amazing is that anyone can become an American by accepting these principles into their life. Unfortunately, the current political climate seems to have forgotten that immigration is what made our country the superpower it is. The demonization of Latino immigrants as 'illegal' persons is despicable. I am glad that your administration has decided to preemptively challenge the Arizona law allowing police officers to check the status of anybody they wanted. I am equally heartened by your recent speech supporting immigration reform that puts the 11 million undocumented people on a path to citizenship. There is more you can do, however. Enforcement of border crimes should focus on criminals and cartels, not innocent families. Deportations have been steadily rising since you assumed the presidency, and this instills a cruel fear in immigrant communities. I strongly urge you remember compassion over politics when crafting your immigration policies. The ideals of the American identity will be on your side.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
