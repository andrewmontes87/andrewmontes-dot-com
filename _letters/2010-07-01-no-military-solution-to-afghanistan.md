Mr. President, there have been several recent developments concerning Afghanistan. A UN report has documented a shocking increase in violence from last year, with June becoming the deadliest month in the entire war - the longest war in American history. The report described the extreme lack of security in Afghanistan, with an average of one assassination a day and three suicide attacks a week. There has been a staggering 94% increase in Improvised Explosive Devices over the same period last year. The already dismal refugee situation has been worsened by displacement in the south resulting from NATO and US military escalations in Helmand and Kandahar; the document reported 27,000 people fleeing from Helmand province in February alone. Overall, the majority of violence against civilians is inflicted by insurgents, but the increasing violence is blamed on stepped-up military operations in the south and southeast. At the same time, public opinion has soured on the never-ending conflict. Recent polls show that 59% of Americans don't believe it is possible to win in Afghanistan, 53% disapprove of your handling of the war, and 48% plurality say that getting out is more important than winning. These numbers illustrate clearly that there is no military solution to Afghanistan.

To make matters worse, a sudden change in command as a result of Gen. Stanley McChrystal's self-immolation in Rolling Stone magazine is adding even more chaos to the situation. For all his faults, Gen. McChrystal's cherished counterinsurgency strategy helped reduce the amount of civilian casualties killed by American and ISAF forces. The incoming commander, Gen. David Patraeus, has stated his commitment to these strict rules of engagement, but it remains to be seen if he will re-escalate the aerial bombardments that kill so many civilians. Needless to say, civilian deaths are not only tragic, but can be deadly when they inspire others to commit violence as revenge.

There is also news of a proposed Pakistani-backed peace deal with the Haqqani Network, a prominent militia that rivals the Quetta Shura Taliban in ferocity. The Taliban know they are not losing. Our recent advances in Marja and Kandahar are not adequately providing the security necessary to build governance in the region. We must begin looking for the exit and withdrawing troops, and the best way to leave a stable Afghanistan behind is through a comprehensive peace agreement with the insurgents. If Pakistan say they can help deliver peace, it is our responsibility to seriously investigate their offer.

The obstacles to a peaceful Afghanistan are numerous: the insurgency of the Haqqani Network, the Quetta Shura Taliban, and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar; the endemic corruption and lack of governance; a refugee crisis and humanitarian disaster; over 30 years of war. The question now is whether our military forces are a help or a hindrance. I believe that the best way forward is to pull out the troops and work with Afghanistan's regional neighbors to cut peace deals with the insurgents. The vast majority of conflicts end with negotiated settlements. Ultimately, there will be a political solution in Afghanistan. Withdrawing our troops would remove a potent source of violence, lower wasteful war spending, and help undermine the narrative that we are at war with Muslims.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
