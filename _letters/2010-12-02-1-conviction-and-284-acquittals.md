title: "45:  1 Conviction and 284 Acquittals"

Mr. President,

On November 17th, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani was found guilty of conspiracy to destroy government buildings and property in the 1998 African embassy bombings. Convicted in a federal court by a jury of American citizens, Ghailani now faces a sentence of 20 years to life for his role in the deadly terrorist attack that killed 224 people in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. The successful prosecution and stiff sentence he faces are further evidence that federal courts are the proper venue try terrorism suspects.

However, Ghailani was not found guilty of every crime he was accused of. He was acquitted of 284 other charges, including one murder count for each of the 224 people killed in the bombings. The main legal barrier to additional convictions was the torture Ghailani faced while held at CIA black sites and Guantanamo Bay during the years between his capture and civilian trial. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan was forced to disallow coerced evidence, including the testimony of Hussein Abebe, a crucial witness for the government.

Now some politicians are using these acquittals to advocate against civilian trials, argueing that all terrorism suspects should be tried by military commission at Guantanamo Bay. They claim that Ghailani came dangerously close to being totally acquitted. In reality, a military tribunal would have been no better, as even the lax evidentiary standards of the Guantanamo commissions prohibit evidence obtained through torture. In any event, there was never any risk that Ghailani would walk free, as the government had preemptively (and disturbingly) claimed the power of "post-acquittal detention". But hack opportunists rarely concern themselves with facts.

In a partisan climate filled with political venom, the easy way out would be to avoid the courts altogether and just hold terrorism suspects indefinitely without trial. There are already close to 50 individuals who have been designated for indefinite detention, and recent public statements from administration officials seem to indicate that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the 9/11 mastermind, will soon join them in legal limbo. But this is not the proper way forward. It is the torturers, not the courts, who are at the root of the problem. This proverbial tainted fruit is the result of the Bush administration's sick zeal for illegal and abusive interrogation methods, and only a thorough investigation into the torture regime will lay this issue to rest. By convicting Ghailani of the crimes supported by the admissible evidence, the courts operated exactly as they should. Terrorism suspects should be tried in Article III courts, not held without trial at Guantanamo.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
