title: "38:  Terrorist Watch Lists and Latif v. Holder "

Mr. President, the dramatic growth of the modern surveillance state is one of the biggest threats to American liberty. The continuous expansion of the terrorist watch list and the “No Fly” list are examples of this ‘more is always better’ attitude towards privacy invasion. The Terrorist Screening Database, commonly known as the watch list, now holds a staggering 1 million names, representing approximately 400,000 individuals. It continues to grow every day, in part because the evidentiary threshold is quite low. A 2007 report from the Government Accountability Office found that the Terrorist Screening Center, the ancillary of the FBI responsible for maintaining the watch list, rejects only 1% of nominations. That means that somebody nominated to the list has a 99% chance of being added. Once on the list it is almost impossible to get off. The only way to contest your designation is to send a form to the Department of Homeland Security with your full identifying information, and hope that they will contact the TSC. Needless to say, this is not a priority for the DHS, and people are rarely removed from the list, no matter how much evidence of their innocence they provide. People on the “No Fly” list have it even worse. Their privacy is invaded without due process, and they are restricted from air travel at the whims of a distant bureaucracy.

The concerns have led to a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the TSC. The plaintiffs in Latif, et al. v. Holder, et al. are challenging the constitutionality of these lists, specifically the inadequacy of redress procedures. These are American citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been placed on the “No Fly” list without due process, in violation of the 5th and 14th amendments. The hardest hit are the 7 plaintiffs (including 3 veterans) who are stranded in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, prevented from returning home to the United States. This forced involuntary exile, imposed on people convicted of no crimes, should not be tolerated. A motion for a preliminary injunction demanding the government allow these plaintiffs to return, subject to appropriate security screening, has been filed. The executive agencies in the defense should concede the case, end “No Fly” exile, and reform the redress procedures. There must be a clear and transparent avenue for innocent people to get themselves off these lists.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
