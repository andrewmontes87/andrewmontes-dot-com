title: "6: Scott Bloch and Executive Lawbreaking"

Mr. President, today the Washington Post reported that Scott J. Bloch, former director of the Office of Special Counsel, will soon plead guilty to charges of withholding evidence from congressional investigators. It appears as though he was trying to hide potentially damaging information that would prove he was mixing political activity with this official non-partisan job. He will join the ranks of former Bush officials that have been convicted for lawbreaking in their official capacity, including Steven Griles and Scooter Libby. Many other officials have been indicted or forced to resign. The list of illegal activities found in the previous administration is staggering: the political purging of US attorneys; the outing of Valerie Plame as a CIA agent; the falsification of evidence in support of war with Iraq; the dismissal of both international and domestic law in the use of military commissions; the CIA renditions and black sites; warrantless wiretapping in the NSA; and of course the most heinous crime of all, the torture of detainees. The case of Scott Bloch, and his imminent guilty plea, is a reminder that despite the current attitude of 'Look Forward, Not Backward', there were serious crimes committed, and our justice system demands investigations. 

The decision not to appoint a special investigator to look into any of these crimes constitutes a threat to our national conceit that we live under a government of laws, not of men. It is true that appointing such an investigator could carry political risks for your party. It is also possible that while you opposed the Bush administration's criminal nature as a Senator and presidential candidate, now that you are president yourself you have grown wary of encouraging a precedent of investigating former administrations for fear that you will be subjected to the same treatment. These risks do not provide an excuse for you to avoid faithfully executing the duties of your office. Where there is significant evidence of lawbreaking, our system of justice requires a thorough investigation - especially when this lawbreaking may have been committed at the highest levels of government. Failing to investigate, and commit to prosecutions if necessary, will allow future administrations to engage in illegal activity with impunity, safe in the knowledge that even the most egregious of their crimes will go unquestioned. Mr. President, it is up to you to ensure the law is followed.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
