title: "32:  Robert Gibbs and the Drug-Addled Left "

Mr. President, earlier today an interview with Press Secretary Robert Gibbs in The Hill was released, and there are several disturbing comments attacking your own supporters. Mr. Gibbs accuses progressives of being impossible to satisfy, claiming that anyone critical of your administration is "crazy" and "on drugs". He also claims that the criticism comes from the "Professional Left" in the DC Beltway, while progressives out in "America" are fully supportive of your accomplishments.

Well, I am not associated with any "professional" advocacy groups, I am thousands of miles from Washington D.C., and I am neither crazy nor on drugs, yet I find myself appalled and insulted by the press secretary's comments. They read as a Republican attack on fringe "hippies". While there are several problems with this line of thinking, perhaps the most egregious claim is that progressives are impossible to please. This is demonstrably false: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, and the commitment to global outreach in your Cairo speech are all examples of achievements celebrated by all your progressive constituents. Despite opposition from conservatives, when your administration wants to push for a strongly progressive outcome, it clearly has the ability to do so.

However, it is certainly true that there is widespread dissatisfaction on the left with the end results of health care reform, stimulus, financial reform, Afghanistan, and civil liberties. On the domestic front, the complaint is that at key moments your administration caved, sacrificing the public option and shrinking the stimulus. Regarding foreign policy, an escalation in Afghanistan and a complete embrace of your predecessor's erosion of civil liberties have always been anathema to progressives. Nevertheless, says Gibbs, people who feel this way are "crazy".

In an election year when Democrats suffer a large enthusiasm gap and are looking at the possibility of losing dozens of congressional seats, one has to question the intelligence of a political strategy that involves attacking your own base. I can't know if Gibbs went off message, or if this disdain for progressives is an honest signal from your administration, but I can tell you that no amount of insults will stop me from expressing displeasure with your actions when I feel you are betraying progressive ideals.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
