Mr. President, the recent Supreme Court decision Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project was a serious blow to the First Amendment rights of peace activists, sending a chilling message to humanitarian organizations worldwide. In brief, 18 U.S.C. §2339B makes it a crime to "knowingly provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization". The Humanitarian Law Project initiated the litigation in order to challenge the overly broad and vague language used to describe what constitutes "material support". The two groups in question, the Partiya Karkeran Kurdistan and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, are undoubtedly terrorist organizations. But the Humanitarian Law Project sought only to further the cause of peace. Their activities, such as training PKK members to use international law and petition the UN for relief, could not have been used to support any violent actions these groups engaged in.

The Court majority thought otherwise. With only three dissenting justices voting to uphold the First Amendment, the decision found that §2339B is constitutional as applied to these particular forms of support. What is particularly ominous is that the Court insisted on a standard of strict scrutiny, thus acknowledging that the activities were purely political speech deserving of the highest respect, and then proceeded to suppress it anyway. They argued that while independent advocacy is fine, coordination with a terrorist group is not. Even if this coordination is expressly designed to be solely related to peaceful activities with the goal of reducing human suffering, it now opens up the humanitarian practitioner to prosecution. Expressing extreme deference to the Legislative and Executive branches, the majority held that national security trumps the bill of rights.

Humanitarian groups are rightly upset. Jimmy Carter has said that the decision "inhibits the work of human rights and conflict resolution groups" like his Carter Center, which has sometimes found it necessary to hold meetings with Hezbollah and Hamas officials in the course of their relief work. Is the former president going to be prosecuted? What about lawyers for terrorism suspects, some of whom are now officials in your administration, including Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal? How far does "coordination" go; are op-eds and amicus briefs in support of accused terrorists a crime?

In humanitarian work, dealing with bad people is sometimes necessary. These heroes should not fear prosecution for working tirelessly to relieve suffering. Attempting to isolate terrorist groups by criminalizing all contact with them is going to have a direct impact on the ability of these groups to advance peace. I strongly urge you to publicly pledge not to prosecute humanitarian workers or organizations. I also ask you to request Congress to expressly protect the rights of relief workers with strong legislation. This case also demonstrates the importance of choosing Supreme Court justices with a respect for the judiciary's role as an upholder of civil liberties. I am heartened that Justice Sotomayor, your first appointment to the Court, voted in dissent. However, I am very concerned about the current nominee, Elena Kagan. After all, Kagan was the Solicitor General who argued Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project for the government, ensuring the shredding of the First Amendment. I can only hope that when she is sitting on that bench, she remembers her duty to the Constitution.

Sincerely,

Andrew Montes
