Building a TODO list app is like the "Hello World" of exploring a new CRUD programming framework. This one is built with Flask and MongoDB, using Flask-WTForms. Create user accounts with a username and password. Passwords are salted and hashed. Create TODO notes and view them in your user dashboard. Update notes or delete them. Update your profile with your email address. Delete your account to erase your data, including all your notes. The app is deployed on Heroku.
